    <p id="one">Hello nice to meet you! It's been a long, strange trip for me from the ports of Savannah, GA all the way to Raleigh,NC. I graduated from the University of Georgia (Go Dawgs!) with a Bachelors in Business Administration Marketing. After leaving college I thought I wanted to be in medical sales, but my journey took me through several companies all which taught me one important lesson. Technology is what drives, builds, and evolves companies today.</p>
    <p id="two">I have always loved technology, new apps, and websites that I have found. I have never really taken the time to think about how they were made and all the debugging and hard work that goes into what I use everyday to make my life easier and more enjoyable. Shortly after coming to Raleigh did I really sit down to look at my future. I needed to take a leap of faith and learn a trade that will always have an impact on people's lives and be enjoyable to work in. I hope you like my site and find everything you need to know about myself. Thank you for taking the time to read my portfolio!</p>
